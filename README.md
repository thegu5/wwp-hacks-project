The Problem
There are thousands of careers and jobs in the computer science and tech fields, yet most people can only name about five different careers. There are careers that are lesser known that some people would love and excels at that is right under their noses.

Our Solution
This hackathon we wanted to take this challenge we've all dealt with head on. We wanted to provide listings of different computer science careers that people may not have known about. We wanted people to be able to add careers we may not have found as well since the industry is always growing.

Our Goal
To help those interested in and exploring computer science to find the perfect career fit for them based on their interests.

What exactly does our project offer?
Careers and Descriptions We list different careers in categories that each would have their own page and a description. We were short on time for descriptions, but we would want it to provide responsibilities, skills needed, education needed, salary, etc.

Submit Other Careers We also know that the tech industry is constantly growing and providing new jobs. We wanted users to also be able to submit other careers they know of to add to our list.

Where we see this project going
There are so many things we wanted to add, but with the time constraint we only could get so much done. We wanted to also include a quiz that would give a few ideas of careers they may be interested and for users to have their own profiles to post updates about their career, schooling, etc. and save different careers they're interested in.

We want to thank WWP Hacks organizers and mentors that made this hackathon possible. We had a lot of fun! and can't wait for next years!
